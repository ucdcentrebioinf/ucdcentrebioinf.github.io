  text: "<b>UCD Centre for Bioinformatics</b>is focused on advancing the quality of bioinformatics science.  It supports academic researchers working in the areas of bioinformatics, genomics and molecular evolution.  It encourages interdisciplinary collaborations inside and outside UCD through PhD programmes, teaching and software provision.  Key areas include sequence alignment, molecular evolution, short peptides, protein structure prediction, cancer, pathogens.
<br>
There is an amazing diversity and quantity of information (with increasingly complex linkages) emerging in the biological and medical sciences. Bioinformatics is the use of computational approaches to make sense of biology, especially to analyse molecular sequences of DNA, RNA and protein. The UCD Centre for Bioinformatics aims to connect and consolidate resources and know-how on campus in one location!
