## TRIDUBIRE

TRIDUBIRE looks to assess the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of populations of the shamrock, <em>Trifolium dubium</em>, across Ireland.

## Background

### The shamrock
<div class="flex">
  <div style="flex: 2;">
  The shamrock, a symbol synonymous with Ireland, encapsulates the country's rich history, culture, and religious traditions. Derived from the Irish word “seamróg”, meaning “young clover,” the shamrock is a well-known symbol of Irish identity and heritage. <br><br>

  The association of the shamrock with St. Patrick, comes the from the myth that St. Patrick used the shamrock as a visual aid to explain the concept of the Holy Trinity to Irish pagans. The shamrock's significance, however, predates Christianity. For the Druids and ancient Irish, the shamrock, with its trifoliate leaves, symbolised the sacred number three, which had mystical associations with various deities in Celtic mythology. <br><br>
  
  Today, the shamrock is a national symbol of Ireland and is used in various state symbols, logos, and emblems, representing Irish identity on the international stage.

    <h3>Who is the "true shamrock"?</h3> 
    <em>There is no single species universally accepted as being the shamrock.</em><br><br>
    
    <u>However</u>, surveys conducted over the years, including those by Nathaniel Colgan in 1893 and E. Charles Nelson in 1988, indicate that the majority of Irish people consider the <b>lesser trefoil, <em>Trifolium dubium</em></b>, to be the <em>"true shamrock"</em>. <a href="/about/#references">(1-3)</a> <em>T. dubium</em> remains the species most commonly grown commercially as "shamrock" and is particularly popular in the run up to St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.

### Lesser trefoil | <em>Trifolium dubium</em>
<em>T. dubium</em> is a small yellow-flowered annual clover. Despite its notoriety as the shamrock, it is not only found in Ireland. <em>T. dubium</em> is native to Western Eurasia and can be found more widely as an introduced species in temperate regions across the globe. The species prefers well-drained soils and can often be spotted growing in grasslands, along roadsides, and in other disturbed areas. <em>T. dubium</em> produces small, yellow flowers that bloom from May to August in the Northern hemisphere.

</div>

#### Ecological significance
<em>T. dubium</em> helps sustain the ecosystems in which it is found. The species provides ground cover, preventing soil erosion and, as a legume, is capable of nitrogen fixation, naturally improving soil fertility. <em>T. dubium</em>'s flowers attract pollinators, contributing to the health of pollinator populations. 

#### Agricultural significance
<em>T. dubium</em> is part of the broader <em>Trifolium</em> (clover) genus, which includes many species with significant agricultural value, such as:
<ul>
    <li>
      <em>Trifolium repens</em> (white clover): Widely used in pasture management, known for its high forage quality and soil nitrogen-fixing abilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Trifolium pratense</em> (red clover): Commonly used as a fodder crop, valued for its deep root system and drought tolerance.
    </li>

    </div>
  </div>
</ul>
<div style="margin: 0;">
Whilst not as prominently used in agriculture, <em>T. dubium</em> holds potential in supporting sustainable agricultural practices and may be useful in areas with poor soil fertility, where other clover species may struggle to establish. Further, <em>T. dubium</em> is noted for its frost tolerance, as well as its production of condensed tannins said to reduce bloat in ruminants. (<a href="/about/#references">5, 6</a>)</div>

## Project overview
TRIDUBIRE aims to assess the genetic diversity within and between Irish populations of <em>T. dubium</em>, offering insights into the species' adaptive potential amidst environmental changes. As part of this, we will sample from both mainland and outlying island populations, evaluating gene flow and assessing population connectivity. 

To achieve this, samples of <em>T. dubium</em> will be collected across Ireland and a pool-seq (pooled sequencing) approach implemented, where the DNA of multiple individuals will be sequenced together as single pool per sample collection site.

TRIDUBIRE will offer essential data for future monitoring and conservation efforts. By providing a genetic baseline for <em>T. dubium</em> in Ireland, the project will enable the tracking of changes in genetic diversity over time, identifying potential threats from environmental changes, and ultimately guiding conservation strategies to preserve this culturally significant species. Additionally, this study can serve as a model for other widespread but ecologically significant species, demonstrating the utility of genomic methods in conservation and agriculture.
