Our outreach and engagement activites are designed to <b>engage and inform on biodiversity conservation</b>, on the <b>importance of genomic information</b> in better understanding the species around us and how this can be used to <b>guide us towards a more sustainable future</b>.

### Local schools
As part of this, over the next academic year we are planning to engage with schools across Ireland through our <b>workshop</b> - <b>SHAMROCKERS</b> ‚òòÔ∏èü§ò. Targeted at primary and Junior cycle students, SHAMROCKERS aims to be both educational and engaging, combining classroom learning with real-world application. Students should hope to be:

- Introduced to the basic concepts of genetics
- Given real-world context for concepts they are learning in class
- Encouraged to curious about and conscious of their local biodiversity
